I'm going to Work on learning and implementing the API Management and gateways as well as testing using jest by friday 15th August, 2025

Later in order to ensure that only real users and business are used to CRUD, as well trace items to users,
I have to set up a system where by each function ensures that the ID's are valid before proceeding to carry out actions. User, business, product and service ID's.  They have to exist in the sytem.
